      <h2>About Our Organization</h2>
      <p>
        At Memorial High School in Frisco, Texas, our Computational Linguistics Club brings together students curious about language, code, and AI. Open to all skill levels, the club explores how computers can understand, generate, and analyze human language—covering everything from speech recognition and syntax parsing to sentiment analysis and chatbot creation. Using a year-long curriculum developed in partnership with LingHacks, members engage in hands‑on learning, team coding projects, and workshops—all provided free of charge. Whether you’re a linguist-in-training, a budding programmer, or simply fascinated by AI, our club provides a fun, supportive environment to explore the future of language technology.

        Join us to dive into the fascinating world of computational linguistics and natural language processing!
