        <h3>Our Year‚ÄëLong Curriculum </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>At Memorial High in Frisco, Texas, our Computational Linguistics Club follows LingHacks‚Äô year‚Äëlong curriculum, taking students from foundations to real-world applications. We kick off with an introduction to NLP and core linguistics, then build essential skills in Python programming, text preprocessing, and math for ML. From there, we move into classic NLP algorithms like Naive Bayes and SVM, followed by deep learning models such as RNNs, transformers, and embeddings. Along the way, members undertake hands-on projects‚Äîbuilding chatbots, spam filters, translation tools, sentiment analyzers, and more‚Äîwhile exploring the ‚ÄúCL‚ÄØ+‚ÄØSociety‚Äù track, which examines bias, fake news, and cyberbullying in language tech. The curriculum also includes mini-prep sessions for linguistics Olympiads, plus guest workshops and mini-hackathons, all offered free to members thanks to our partnership with LingHacks.</li>
